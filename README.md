[Context]
The dataset was created by my team during the NASA Space Apps Challenge in 2018, the goal was using the dataset to develop a model that can recognize the images with fire.

(Hint) : Data is skewed, which means the 2 classes(folders) doesn't have an equal number of samples, so make sure that you have a validation set with an equally-sized number of images per class (eg: 40 images of both fire and non-fire classes).
